###INHERITANCE
  PRoperties and behaviour are inherited from supper class  to subclss
  i.e class Grandpa():--- superclass
  
        class dad(grandpa):-- subclass

NB:
    sometimes it is possible to have more than 1 subclass 
    
    
    TYPES OF INHERITANCE
    1.SINGLE inheritance-- is when a class inherits from a single class
            class BaseClass:
                ------ 
                ---
            class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
                body of DerivedClass
                

        
        
    2.MULTIPLE INHERITANCE -- is formed when a class inherit from multiple classes
        class Mother:
            -----
            -----
        
        class Father:
            -----
            -----
        
        class Child(Father,Mother):
            
    
    
    
    3.MULTILEVEL INHERITANCE-- is formed when a derived class inherits another derived class
 
    4.HIERARCHICAL inheritance
    5.HYBRID inheritance
