A subclass is to be created having all properties and behavior from the StudentAge but have itâ€™s own name and age and the same method and
same parameter as that one of StudentAge. Write a program to show how StudentAge is overridden by the subclass method declared. 
How do you do if you want to avoid override method?, for a instance the output be :-

# so as to perform overriding there should be inheritance
